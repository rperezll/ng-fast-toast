After installing and configuring Tailwind CSS and ng-fast-toast, you can easily start using toast notifications in your Angular application. Follow the steps below to integrate and display toast messages.

<Alert type="info">
  Remember that this library **also works with Ionic**. You can check out the
  test project, which presents an **Ionic template** project with the
  installation of **ng-fast-toast**. [Visit the
  project](https://github.com/rperezll/ng-fast-toast/tree/main/test/ionic-project)
</Alert>

## Import the Toast Component

To use the toast notifications, first, you need to import the NgFastToastComponent in your main application component.

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { NgFastToastComponent } from "ng-fast-toast";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgFastToastComponent],
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Add the Toast selector

Next, add the `<ng-fast-toast>` selector to your component's template (e.g., app.component.html). This is where the toast notifications will be rendered.

```html
<ng-fast-toast></ng-fast-toast>
```

Once this is done, you'll see a log message in the browser's console:

```text
üçû ng-fast-toast initialized correctly with default config.
```

## Use the Toast Service

Now that the component is set up, you can inject the NgFastToastService and use it to display toast notifications in your component.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, inject } from "@angular/core";
import { NgFastToastService } from "ng-fast-toast";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [NgFastToastComponent],
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  toast = inject(NgFastToastService);

  ngOnInit() {
    this.toast.success({ content: "ng-fast-toast is ready!" });
  }
}
```

When the component is initialized, a success notification will appear with the message "ng-fast-toast is ready!" üöÄ.
