The different types of toast notifications available are provided by the **NgFastToastService**, which exports the necessary methods for their usage.

```ts
import { NgFastToastService } from "ng-fast-toast";

fastToast = inject(NgFastToastService);
```

## Success

The warning toast indicates a potential issue or caution within our system.

```ts
this.fastToast.success({
  title: "Perfect!",
  content: "Good Job today.",
  duration: 5,
});
```

It takes a `Notification` object as a parameter and returns `void`.

<Alert type="info">
  You can view the specification of all the types used on the [**types
  page**](/types).
</Alert>

## Warning

The warning toast indicates a potential issue or caution within our system.

```ts
this.fastToast.warn({
  title: "Listen!",
  content: "You are about to do something that could be dangerous.",
  duration: 5,
});
```

It takes a `Notification` object as a parameter and returns `void`.

<Alert type="info">
  You can view the specification of all the types used on the [**types
  page**](/types).
</Alert>

## Error

The error toast represents a failure or an issue within our system.

```ts
this.fastToast.error({
  title: "Ooh no!",
  content: "Something went wrong. Please try again later.",
  duration: 5,
});
```

It takes a `Notification` object as a parameter and returns `void`.

<Alert type="info">

  page**](/types).
</Alert>

## Loading

The loading toast is used when invoking an asynchronous process, displaying a loading notification, and then updating it based on whether the process succeeds or fails.

```ts
const guid = await this.fastToast.loading({
  title: "Waiting for...",
  content: "I am processing...",
  duration: 50000,
});

// Do something async...

this.fastToast.updateLoading(guid, "error", {
  title: "Completed!",
  content: "The process has finished.",
  duration: 5,
});
```

The loading toast returns a **promise with a guid**, which can be used to update the toast using the **updateLoading** method.

The **updateLoading** method takes the **guid** from the promise response, a **newType** of type `NotificationType`, and a **notification** of type `Notification`.
