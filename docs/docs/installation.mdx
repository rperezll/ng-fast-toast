## Install the library

To integrate toast notifications into your Angular project, you need to install the `ng-fast-toast` library. This package provides an easy-to-use service for displaying customizable toast notifications.

Run the following command to install it:

```bash
npm i ng-fast-toast
```

## Configure Tailwind

To ensure that Tailwind CSS properly scans the `ng-fast-toast` package files for utility classes, you need to update your `tailwind.config` file. Add the following configuration to the `content` array in your `tailwind.config`:

```ts
content: [
  "./node_modules/ng-fast-toast/**/*.{html,ts,js,mjs}"
],
```
